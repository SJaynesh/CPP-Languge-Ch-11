# Exception Handling :

<br>

## What is Exception? 

<br>

> * `BUG`
> * `Logical mistake of code which is unable to handle by compiler.`
> * Exception breakes the flow of compiler in between the process of execution.
> * It's a run time process(error).

## Difference between Error & Exception :

<br>

Error | Exception
-------- | -----------
Syntax mistake of code which is unable to handle by compiler. | Logical mistake of code which is unable to handle by compiler.
It happens on compile time. | It happens on run time.
It Occures by Developer. | It Occures by Developer and User both.

## What is Exception Handling? 

<br>

> * `To verify the code in every possible way which can generate an exception and handle that all scenarious is called exception handling.`
> * It prevents the exceptions by some blocks by providing an optional code which will be only executed if exception is occured.
> * It can be handled by try and catch block.

### try block :

<br>

> * Write a code which may produce an exception.
> * Throw Value;

<br>

### catch() block :

<br>

> * Solution of that specific exception.

<br>

### Syntax :

<br>

<pre>
  try {
    //Statement which may cause an exception
		throw value/exception;
  }
  catch([excention/argument]) {
    //Solution for specific exception.
  }
</pre>
